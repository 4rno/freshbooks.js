Freshbooks.js
=============

Freshbooks.js is a node.js module providing a wrapper to the FreshBooks API. This is still a work in progress and is subject to change.

## Installation
  $ git clone git://github.com/Metacrash/freshbooks.js.git freshbooks.js
  
This module uses [libxmljs](https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs) so requires the installation of *libxml2* and *libxml2-devel* (*libxml2-dev* on Debian).

  % sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev
