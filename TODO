 - Use XML builder rather than string concat in Invoice/Estimate.list()
 - Impliment custom email in Invoice/Estimate.sendByEmail()

var estimate = new self.freshbooks.Estimate()
            , xml = libxml.Document()
            , response = xml.node("response", a.toString())
            , estimates = [];
            
          response.attr("xmlns", "http://www.freshbooks.com/api/");
          response.attr("status", "ok");
          //response.cdata(a.toString());
          
          console.log(xml);
          
          estimate._getXML(xml, function() {
            estimates.push(estimate);
          });


//this isn't a direct correlation of the API
CLIENT.credits


CLIENT.notification && .contacts (API is different to documentation, need to confirm what is happening here!?)
we're actually not even implimenting contacts, need to fix?

we can remove options from .list declaration completely as its hoisted
